I have used cosine similarity for getting recommended movie's indices. Cosine similarity is a metric used to measure how similar the documents are irrespective of their size. Mathematically, it measures the cosine of the angle between two vectors projected in a multi dimensional space. The smaller the angle, higher the cosine similarity.
